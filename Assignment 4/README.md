# Number Theory

For given integers m, n, recall that Bezoutâ€™s Identity gives the existence of integers x, y such
that
gcd(m, n) = ax + by
(a) What can you say about the uniqueness of such pairs of integers (x, y)?
(b) Write a C++/Python program which outputs a pair (x, y) satisfying the above identity
for an input (m, n).
