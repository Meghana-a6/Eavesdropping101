Problem Statement:

" Going to meet Larry Page, the founder of [google.com](google.com)? Must be <ins>**_feeling lucky_**</ins> no? Not that easy kid. Decipher the following and whisper the password to start this journey.

Make sure that you are careful in every step and **_inspect every element_** of the problem. This **_class_** ain't an easy one."

### Solution

We are supposed to perform a ciphrtext-only attack. However, along with that we also have a riddle, so it is more of a puzzle than an attack :).

Since the cipher seemed like a substitution or permutation cipher, we proceeded with the frequency analysis of the cipher text. The frequency analysis revealed an Index of Coincidence of around 0.042. This analysis indicated a Vigen√®re Cipher.

To use the Vigenere cipher, a key is required, this key is provided from the clues in the problem statement. The approach has been listed in the ```decryption.ipynb``` file.

Thus, using the found key, and assuming Vigenere cipher, decryption was performed which furnished legible text. Puntuaction and spaces where added to the decrypted text to obtain final plaintext message.

### Password

The password is ```the_fun_has_only_begun```.
